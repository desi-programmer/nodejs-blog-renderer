## Reading PDF Files From Assets ðŸ¤ž

First, we need to add the following plugins to our **pubspec.yaml**{.key} file And then fetch all the plugins. The pdf\_flutter plugin will be used to read and display PDF files. The file\_picker plugin will be used to pick a file from the local storage.  
Now the path\_provider plugin and the pdf plugin well together help us in creating and saving a PDF file as path provider plugin will give us a path to save our file and the PDF plugin will help us in creating a PDF file.

```dart
  pdf_flutter: ^1.1.3
  file_picker: ^1.13.3
  
  pdf: ^1.10.1
  path_provider: ^1.6.11
```
            

Working with pdf\_flutter is very simple and here are quick examples on how you can open a file from the internet, from the assets or how you can pick a file using the file\_picker plugin and then display the file content using PDF plugin.  
I have allowed only the PDF extension in file\_picker to make sure that we don't end up getting errors

To Open a File from internet

```dart    
  PDF.network(
      // file url
     'http://africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf',
     // optional height and width
     height: 600,
     width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.90,
  ),
```
